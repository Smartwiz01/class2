    <h2>Introduction#</h2>
    <p>
        Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

        Dependency Management#
    </h2>
    <p>
        Composer is not a package manager in the same sense as Yum or Apt are. Yes, it deals with "packages" or libraries, but it manages them on a per-project basis, installing them in a directory (e.g. vendor) inside your project. By default, it does not install anything globally. Thus, it is a dependency manager. It does however support a "global" project for convenience via the global command.

        This idea is not new and Composer is strongly inspired by node's npm and ruby's bundler.
        
        Suppose:
        <ol>
            <li>You have a project that depends on a number of libraries.</li>
            <li>Some of those libraries depend on other libraries.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
Composer
<OL>
    <LI>Enables you to declare the libraries you depend on.</LI>
    <LI>Finds out which versions of which packages can and need to be installed, and installs them (meaning it downloads them into your project).</LI>
    <LI>You can update all your dependencies in one command.</LI>
</OL>
    </p>
